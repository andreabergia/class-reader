# class-reader

A library to read a JVM `.class` file. Not particularly complete nor well written - it is mostly a learning project.

Can be used as a standard Rust library, but also built as a wasm module via [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/). I have built and published a version at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andreabergia/class-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andreabergia/class-reader). See [https://github.com/andreabergia/class-reader-ui](https://github.com/andreabergia/class-reader-ui) for a demo webapp that uses the library in the browser.

Extracted from [https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm](https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm).
